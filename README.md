# drupal-scaffold

Composer plugin for automatically downloading Drupal scaffold files (like
`index.php`, `update.php`, â€¦) when using `drupal/core` via Composer.

## Usage

`composer require drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold:dev-master` in your composer
project before installing or updating `drupal/core`.

## Configuration

You can configure the plugin with providing some settings in the `extra` section
of your root `composer.json`.

```json
{
  "extra": {
    "drupal-scaffold": {
      "source": "http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-{version}.tar.gz",
      "excludes": [
        "google123.html",
        "robots.txt"
      ],
      "includes": [
        "sites/default/example.settings.my.php"
      ],
      "omit-defaults": false
    }
  }
}
```
The `source` option may be used to specify the URL to download the
scaffold files from; the default source is drupal.org.  The literal string
`{version}` in the `source` option is replaced with the current version of 
Drupal core being updated prior to download.

With the `drupal-scaffold` option `excludes`, you can provide additional paths 
that should not be copied or overwritten. Default excludes are provided by the 
plugin:
```
.gitkeep
autoload.php
composer.json
composer.lock
core
drush
example.gitignore
LICENSE.txt
README.txt
vendor
sites
themes
profiles
modules
```

If there are some files inside of an excluded location that should be
copied over, they can be individually selected for inclusion via the
`includes` option.  Default includes are provided by the plugin:
```
sites/default/default.settings.php
sites/default/default.services.yml
sites/example.settings.local.php
sites/example.sites.php
```

When setting `omit-defaults` to `true`, neither the default excludes nor the
default includes will be provided; in this instance, only those files explicitly
listed in the `excludes` and `includes` options will be considered.  If
`omit-defaults` is `false` (the default), then any items listed in `excludes`
or `includes` will be in addition to the usual defaults.

## Custom command

The plugin by default is only downloading the scaffold files when installing or
updating `drupal/core`. If you want to call it manually, you have to add the 
command callback to the `scripts`-section of your root `composer.json`, like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "drupal-scaffold": "DrupalComposer\\DrupalScaffold\\Plugin::scaffold"
  }
}
```

After that you can manually download the scaffold files according to your
configuration by using `composer drupal-scaffold`.
